    "Even though it was instructed to avoid it, Goldfang (still just find the name funny) made huge trades anyway. It invested ~40% in Nike because it thought it was undervalued, and hey, maybe it is / was. But it will take months or years to prove out if this kind of investing is really successful or just lucky, and by then the place will be saturated by bots that are doing something similar because it's just too easy.\n",

    "The basic loop I built was to look at stocks one at a time, and ignore almost all other information. I chose randomly from a list of 200 S&P 500 stocks that ChatGPT made. Maybe there's a better way to choose which stocks to look at: which ones have news associated with them, and ask Goldfang if it's worth trading on this news.\n",

    "I built a placeholder for feeding back open-ended data into the model, but haven't decided how to implement that. I don't think there's anything I could use as an _effective_ oracle right now. It would be sweet if I could feed those queries into a Bing Chat API or Perplexity API, have it do whatever searches it needs to do, and receive a paragraph back of text answering the question in a way that's probably correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "Upon conducting a thorough analysis of NVDA, here are the requested details on its dividend history, market competition, and supply chain risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividend History:\n",
    "NVDA has a relatively short dividend history as it only began paying dividends in 2012. Since then, the company has steadily increased its dividend payout, with a current yield of 0.14%. However, it's essential to note that NVDA's primary focus is on growth, and dividend payments are not its top priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Competition:\n",
    "NVDA operates in a highly competitive market, with key competitors including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM). While NVDA has managed to gain a significant market share in the gaming and data center markets, competitors are continually innovating and releasing new products, which could impact NVDA's market position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply Chain Risks:\n",
    "NVDA's supply chain is relatively complex, with the company relying on multiple suppliers for essential components. As such, there is always a risk of supply chain disruptions, particularly in times of global economic turbulence or geopolitical tensions. Any disruptions could result in production delays, which could ultimately impact NVDA's financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this information helps in your assessment of NVDA.\n",
