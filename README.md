## goal

I want to create a stock trading bot with GPT-4. OpenAI doesn't want people to do this, so the bot refuses if you ask it for this kind of financial advice. However, if we translate the stock picking into a fantasy world and query in that world, we can get around the safety hardening. How does the bot do?
